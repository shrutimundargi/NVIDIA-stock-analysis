Strategic Analysis and Trading Strategy Development for NVIDIA and Peer Companies


## 1. NVIDIA Stock and Its Competitors
This project focuses on analyzing NVIDIA and its main competitors within the semiconductor industry, such as AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and Micron Technology. Utilizing historical stock data, the analysis aims to uncover trends and performance metrics that highlight how NVIDIA's stock behavior compares against these companies. The project leverages data visualization techniques, including line graphs and candlestick charts, to illustrate price movements and trading volumes, offering insights into market dynamics and competitive positioning.


## 2. Feature Extraction and Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a critical component of this project, where key variables are derived from raw data to better represent underlying patterns relevant to stock price movements. This includes creating lagged features of prices and returns, which help in capturing temporal dynamics. Additionally, volume and price change percentages are utilized as features to predict future stock movements, setting a robust foundation for the subsequent predictive modeling.


## 3. Feature Importance Using Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net vs Random Forest, XGBoost
The project employs several machine learning techniques to evaluate the importance of the engineered features. Regression models like Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net are used alongside tree-based methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of which features most significantly predict stock prices, aiding in refining the models to improve their predictive accuracy.


## 4. Preparing Models for Prediction and Performing Model Comparison
Multiple predictive models are developed and compared to assess their effectiveness in forecasting stock prices. The models include Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors model), and XGBoost. Each model is evaluated based on its predictive performance, with a particular focus on comparing their Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values to determine which model provides the most accurate forecasts.


## 5. Composition of Trading Rules
Trading rules are formulated based on the insights gained from the predictive models. The strategies explored in the project include buy-and-hold, long-short, and day trading. These rules are tailored to leverage predicted stock movements, aiming to optimize trading outcomes by taking advantage of identified trends and forecasted price changes.


## 6. Generate Trading Signals Using the Above Models. Compare Their PnL.
Finally, the project implements the trained models to generate trading signals. These signals are used to simulate trading scenarios, where the practical application of each model is tested through real-world trading execution. The profitability of each trading strategy is analyzed by comparing the profit and loss (PnL) achieved, providing a clear indication of the financial viability and effectiveness of each predictive model in guiding trading decisions.
